# Getting started with Adyen Postman flows

The Adyen Postman flows provide a visual representation of the workflows you can design with the Adyen APIs. A flow shows how API calls can
be chained and how data can be passed between the various steps.


## First time users

Are you accessing the Adyen Postman flows for the first time? Checkout the steps required to setup the environment and everything else you need.

* Fork the "Adyen Flows" environment. Keep the forked environment **private** to protect sensitive information like API key, merchant account, etc..
* Edit the local "Adyen Flows" environment (forked above) to define the settings necessary to perform the API calls
* Fork the desired flow (for example "Giving")
* Edit the local flow (forked above) to use the "Adyen Flows" environment. This is necessary to run the flow with your own keys and configuration
* Define the variables (for example "amount")
* Run the flow

## Update local flows 

If you want to edit the local flow (forked above) you need to fork also the "Adyen Flows" collection.
